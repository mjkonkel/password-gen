# Challenge 3 - Create a Password Generator

## Description

This repo contains code for the Password Generator challenge of the bootcamp. In the process of making this application, I was able to practice the JavaScript I have been learning in class. We have been learning basic JavaScript and this was an opportunity to incorporate several different concepts into a single project. Some JavaSCript concepts I included in this project are: for loops, functions, and if statements.
